# Hello World

Welcome to my new portfolio website! This is my first blog post using MDX.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

```jsx
import { Chart } from '../components/Chart'

# Here's a chart

<Chart data={[1, 2, 3]} />
```

## Why I built this site

I wanted to create a modern, responsive portfolio website to showcase my work and share my thoughts on various technical topics.

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
